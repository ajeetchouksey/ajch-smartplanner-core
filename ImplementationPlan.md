# Implementation Plan for Integrating OneDrive and Dropbox as File Stores

This document outlines a step-by-step plan to integrate OneDrive and Dropbox as file storage options in the app, enabling users to authenticate using Gmail or Microsoft accounts and allowing file read and write operations during an active session.

---

## Step 1: App Registration and API Setup

### OneDrive Integration
1. Register your app in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Configure API permissions for OneDrive:
   - Files.ReadWrite
3. Set up the redirect URI to handle OAuth 2.0 authentication.
4. Note down the Client ID and Client Secret for use in your app.

### Dropbox Integration
1. Create an app in the [Dropbox App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps).
2. Configure permissions:
   - files.content.write
   - files.metadata.read
3. Set up the redirect URI for OAuth 2.0 authentication.
4. Obtain the App Key and App Secret for integration.

## Step 2: Backend Implementation

1. **Authentication:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows for both OneDrive and Dropbox.
   - Use libraries like MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Library) for OneDrive.
   - Use Dropbox SDKs for Dropbox OAuth flows.

2. **Token Management:**
   - Securely store access tokens during the user session.
   - Implement logic to refresh tokens when they expire.

3. **File Operations:**
   - Use respective APIs to perform file operations (read, write, list files):
     - OneDrive: Microsoft Graph API (e.g., `/me/drive/root/children`, `/me/drive/root:/path/to/file:/content`)
     - Dropbox: Dropbox API (e.g., `/files/list_folder`, `/files/upload`)

## Step 3: Frontend Implementation

1. Add authentication buttons for Google and Microsoft accounts.
2. Provide a UI for users to select their preferred file storage option (OneDrive or Dropbox).
3. Implement file selection and upload interfaces.

---

## Step 4: Testing and Debugging

1. Test authentication flows for both OneDrive and Dropbox.
2. Verify file operations (read, write, list) for different scenarios.
3. Debug and handle errors such as invalid tokens or permission issues.

---

## Step 5: Deployment and Monitoring

1. Deploy the updated app to a staging environment.
2. Monitor API usage and handle rate-limiting scenarios.
3. Collect user feedback and make improvements as needed.
