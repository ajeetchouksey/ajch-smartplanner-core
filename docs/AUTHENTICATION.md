# Authentication & User Management

## Features
- Centralized login and registration
- Social authentication (Google, Facebook, Microsoft)
- Role management (admin, co-admin, user)
- Passwordless and multi-factor authentication
- Session management and token refresh
- User provisioning and onboarding
- Account recovery and password reset
- Audit logging for authentication events

## Tech Implementation
- Azure AD B2C for identity management and user directory
- OAuth2 for social login integration
- JWT tokens for secure, stateless authorization
- RBAC enforced in backend APIs and frontend UI
- Secure session handling and token refresh logic
- API endpoints for registration, login, role assignment, and password reset
- Logging and monitoring with Azure Monitor/Application Insights
- Compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)

## Reusability
- Shared authentication and user management for all planner apps
- Modular and extensible for new roles, permissions, or authentication methods
- Easily integrated with other reusable services (profile, notifications)

## Example API Endpoints
- `POST /auth/register` — Register a new user
- `POST /auth/login` — Authenticate and receive JWT
- `POST /auth/role` — Assign or change user role (admin only)
- `POST /auth/password-reset` — Initiate password reset

## Deployment Considerations
- Infrastructure as code (IaC) for repeatable deployments
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Environment configuration for dev, test, prod
- Monitoring, alerting, and logging for reliability

## Alignment & Relevance
- This document supports planning, coding, and deployment of authentication as a reusable, secure, and compliant service for the SmartPlanner platform.
