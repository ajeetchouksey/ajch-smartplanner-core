## Integration Scenarios
- **Travel App:** “Plan my trip to Paris next month.” → Chatbot creates itinerary, suggests budget, syncs with finance app
- **Finance App:** “How much can I spend on travel this year?” → Chatbot analyzes budgets, cross-references travel plans
- **Health App:** “Remind me to take my medication during travel.” → Chatbot sets reminders, syncs with travel itinerary
- **Day Planner:** “Add a meeting for tomorrow at 10am.” → Chatbot updates daily schedule, checks for conflicts

## Deployment Considerations
- Infrastructure as code (IaC) for repeatable deployments (e.g., Bicep, ARM templates)
- CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and security checks
- Environment configuration for dev, test, prod
- Monitoring, alerting, and logging for reliability

## Alignment & Relevance
- All details in this document are designed to support planning, coding, and deployment of the chatbot service as a reusable, AI-powered core component for the SmartPlanner platform.
