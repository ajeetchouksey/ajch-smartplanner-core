### Roles & Permissions
1. **Admin**
	- Full access: manage users, settings, data, and all app features.
	- Can use all user functionalities.
	- Can assign/revoke co-admins.
	- Only admin can add co-admins; users cannot self-assign or be assigned by co-admins.

2. **Co-Admin**
	- Can view (read-only) admin settings and analytics.
	- Can use all user functionalities.
	- Cannot change admin-level settings or manage users.

3. **User**
	- Automatically added based on user access to core app (self-registration or first login).
	- Can use planner app features relevant to their profile.
	- No access to admin/co-admin settings.

#### Recommendations & Best Practices
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC in both backend APIs and frontend UI to enforce permissions and ensure security.
- **Clear Role Assignment:** Only admins should have the ability to assign co-admins, reducing risk and maintaining control.
- **Automatic User Provisioning:** Users should be provisioned automatically upon first access, streamlining onboarding and reducing admin overhead.
- **Audit Logging:** Log all admin and co-admin actions for compliance and traceability.
- **Extensibility:** Design the roles and permissions system to be easily extendable for future roles or more granular permissions.
- **User Experience:** Clearly communicate available features and access levels to users based on their role, and hide or disable restricted features in the UI.

# SmartPlanner App Concept

## Overview
SmartPlanner is a combination of planner apps, each dedicated to a specific planning domain (Travel, Finance, Health, Daily, etc.). Every app is powered by AI and ML for intelligent recommendations, automation, and insights tailored to user needs. While these apps are distinct, they share common principles for data protection, compliance, and UI consistency.



### Individual and Family Planning Support
- **Flexible Planning Contexts:** Allow users to create plans for themselves (individual) or for groups (family, friends, teams).
- **User & Group Profiles:**
	- Extend user profiles to support group/family profiles with multiple members.
	- Each plan can be linked to an individual or a group context.
- **Permissions & Privacy:**
	- Let users control who can view, edit, or participate in group plans.
	- Ensure privacy and consent for shared/group data.
- **UI Recommendations:**
	- Provide easy switching between individual and group planning modes.
	- Show relevant analytics and recommendations for both contexts.
- **Data Model Example:**
	- `UserProfile`: Individual user data
	- `GroupProfile`: List of members, shared preferences, group plans
	- `Plan`: Linked to either a `UserProfile` or `GroupProfile`

### Core AI-Powered Chatbot Service
- **Central Chatbot Service:** Implement an AI-powered chatbot as a core service, accessible across all planner apps. The chatbot will assist users, help plan activities, and switch context between apps as needed.
- **Recommended Architecture:**
	- Host the chatbot as a shared microservice (Azure Functions or containerized service).
	- Use Azure OpenAI for natural language understanding and context switching.
	- Integrate with MCP for context management and traceability.
	- Expose chatbot via secure APIs for all apps to consume.
	- Log interactions for continuous improvement and compliance.


### Comprehensive User Dashboard (Main Landing Page)
- **Unified & Intelligent Dashboard:** The main landing page will feature a comprehensive dashboard that aggregates and analyzes user activities, insights, and recommendations across all planner apps. This enables:
	- Cross-app data integration for smarter suggestions (e.g., travel plans affecting finance, health routines adapting to travel, etc.)
	- Personalized analytics and activity summaries
	- AI-powered recommendations based on combined app data
	- Quick navigation to all planner apps and core features
	- Mobile-first, responsive design using shared UI components
	- User control and transparency over data sharing between apps

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **MCP Implementation:** Integrate Model Context Protocol (MCP) to standardize context sharing and model interactions across AI/ML services and apps. MCP enables better interoperability, traceability, and governance for AI-powered features.

### AI/ML-First Approach
- **Cloud-Native AI/ML:** Maximize use of managed AI/ML services (Azure OpenAI, Azure Cognitive Services, Azure ML) for recommendations, chatbots, analytics, sentiment analysis, and personalization.
- **API-Based Integration:** Expose AI/ML features as APIs (e.g., /recommendations, /chat, /analytics) for all apps to consume.
- **Automated Model Training & Deployment:** Use Azure ML pipelines and MLOps best practices for training, deploying, and updating models.
- **Embedded AI in User Experience:**
	- Smart recommendations (travel, finance, health, daily routines)
	- Conversational assistants (chatbots)
	- Predictive analytics (budget, health trends)
	- Personalization (content, notifications)
	- Natural language processing (search, feedback)
- **Continuous Monitoring & Improvement:** Track AI/ML performance and user engagement with Azure Monitor and Application Insights. Continuously improve models based on real usage.
- **Modular AI/ML Services:** Keep AI/ML logic in shared services or APIs for reuse and scalability across all apps.
### Authentication and User Identity
- **Third-Party Authentication:** Users can authenticate using Facebook, Gmail, or Microsoft accounts. For each user, the app generates a unique internal user ID.
- **No Storage of External Data:** The app does not store any personal data from these authentication providers. Instead, it encrypts the username and generates a simple user ID for use across the app.
### Best Practices for Minimal User and Data Management
- **Local-First Data Storage:** Store all original, detailed user data on the user's device. Only sync or upload minimal, anonymized, or aggregated data needed for AI/ML analysis and recommendations.
- **Ephemeral Data Processing:** Process sensitive data in-memory or locally, never persisting it to the cloud/server unless absolutely necessary.
- **User-Controlled Data Sharing:** Let users explicitly choose what data to share for analysis or recommendations, with clear consent dialogs and privacy controls.
- **Data Minimization:** Only collect and retain data strictly necessary for app functionality. Regularly purge or anonymize temporary data.
- **Strong Security & Compliance:** Encrypt all data in transit and at rest. Use secure authentication and authorization. Comply with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA).
- **Transparency & User Rights:** Allow users to view, export, modify, or delete their data. Provide audit logs for data access.
- **Shared Profile, Minimal Metadata:** Maintain a centralized user profile with only essential metadata (e.g., user ID, preferences, minimal history). Avoid storing raw planner entries or sensitive details in the cloud.
- **Distinct Planner Apps:** Each planner (Travel, Finance, Health, Daily, etc.) is a separate application, allowing for independent development and deployment.
- **AI/ML Support:** All apps leverage AI and machine learning for personalized suggestions, predictive analytics, and automation (e.g., trip planning, financial forecasting, health tracking, daily routines).
- **Minimal Data Storage:** Only the minimum user data required for analyzing patterns and generating recommendations is stored by each app. All original, detailed user data remains securely on the user's local device. Apps access or process this data locally when needed, ensuring privacy and compliance.
- **User Data Protection & Compliance:**
	- Strong authentication (OAuth2, multi-factor authentication)
	- Data encryption at rest and in transit (TLS/SSL, AES)
	- Compliance with regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
	- User consent and privacy policy management
	- Data export, modification, and deletion options for users
	- Audit logging for sensitive data access
- **Centralized User Profile & Shared Services:** Unified user management, authentication, and compliance infrastructure are shared across all planner apps.
- **Consistent UI:** All apps use a shared UI library and design system to ensure a consistent user experience.
- **Secure APIs:** All apps interact with user data via secure, compliant APIs.


## Architecture Suggestions
- Separate applications for each planner domain (Travel, Finance, Health, Daily, etc.)
- Shared infrastructure for authentication, user profile, compliance, and UI library
- Each planner app as a separate AI/ML-enabled application
- Secure communication between apps and shared services

## Next Steps
1. Define data models for user profiles, planner entries, and chatbot interactions
2. Select technology stack (backend, frontend, database, AI/ML frameworks)
3. Draft privacy policy and compliance checklist
4. Design initial architecture diagram
5. Prototype the chatbot microservice and dashboard UI
