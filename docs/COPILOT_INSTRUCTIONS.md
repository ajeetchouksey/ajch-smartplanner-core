Add these instructions to your GitHub Copilot configuration or development guidelines:

## ðŸ¤– **Professional Documentation Directive**

```markdown
@documentation Rule - Professional Documentation Standards:

When creating, updating, or analyzing any aspect of the SmartPlanner project:

1. **Sequential Thinking Requirement**:
   - Always employ sequential thinking for complex analysis and recommendations
   - Break down problems into logical, manageable steps
   - Document your reasoning process and decision rationale
   - Consider multiple perspectives and alternative solutions
   - Validate conclusions against requirements and constraints

2. **Professional Quality Standards**:
   Every design, architecture, feature, service, and documentation artifact must be very professional and include:
   - Comprehensive architectural diagrams using Mermaid or PlantUML
   - Detailed use cases with actor interactions and sequence diagrams
   - Complete user stories with clear acceptance criteria
   - Technical specifications with implementation details
   - Security considerations and compliance requirements
   - Performance metrics and scalability planning
   - Accessibility standards (WCAG AA/AAA compliance)

3. **Automatic Documentation Creation**:
   Automatically create and update documentation following these standards:
   - Generate new documentation files when creating features or services
   - Update existing documentation when modifying systems or components
   - Maintain consistency across all documentation artifacts
   - Follow the established folder structure: docs/{architecture,features,api,deployment}
   - Use proper naming conventions and cross-reference related documents

4. **Required Documentation Artifacts**:
   For every feature or system component, ensure the following exist:
   - **Architecture Documentation**: System diagrams, component interactions, data flows
   - **Feature Specifications**: User stories, use cases, acceptance criteria, UI mockups
   - **API Documentation**: Complete endpoint specs with examples, error codes, rate limits
   - **Security Documentation**: Threat models, security controls, compliance mappings
   - **Testing Documentation**: Test plans, scenarios, automation strategies
   - **Deployment Documentation**: Setup guides, configuration, monitoring

5. **Industry Best Practices Compliance**:
   Ensure all documentation follows enterprise-grade standards:
   - Use proper technical writing standards with clear, concise language
   - Include version control and change tracking information
   - Provide clear examples, code snippets, and configuration samples
   - Maintain accessibility and readability standards
   - Follow semantic versioning for documentation releases
   - Include proper metadata and tagging for searchability

6. **Quality Validation Requirements**:
   Before completing any task, verify:
   - All documentation is complete, accurate, and up-to-date
   - Diagrams accurately reflect current architecture and data flows
   - All links and references are valid and accessible
   - Consistency with existing documentation standards and style
   - Spelling, grammar, and formatting meet professional standards
   - Code examples are tested and functional
   - Security and compliance requirements are addressed

7. **Automation and Tooling**:
   Utilize and maintain automation for:
   - Documentation generation from code annotations and comments
   - Diagram synchronization with code changes and dependencies
   - Link validation and broken reference detection
   - Documentation deployment and publishing workflows
   - Quality assurance checks and style validation
   - Version synchronization with code releases

8. **Specific SmartPlanner Requirements**:
   For the SmartPlanner ecosystem, ensure documentation covers:
   - OAuth authentication flows and security implementations
   - Shared UI component library usage and styling standards
   - Multi-tenant architecture and data isolation strategies
   - AI/ML integration patterns and data processing workflows
   - Performance optimization and scalability considerations
   - Monitoring, logging, and observability implementations
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Implementation Guidelines**

### **When to Apply These Standards**
- Creating new features or services
- Modifying existing system components
- Performing architectural changes
- Adding integrations or dependencies
- Updating security or compliance requirements
- Resolving bugs or performance issues

### **Documentation Triggers**
Automatically generate or update documentation when:
- New API endpoints are created
- Database schemas are modified
- Configuration parameters change
- Dependencies are added or updated
- Security policies are implemented
- Performance metrics are established

### **Quality Gates**
Before any code merge or deployment:
- [ ] All affected documentation is updated
- [ ] Architecture diagrams reflect current state
- [ ] API documentation includes all endpoints
- [ ] Security documentation covers new risks
- [ ] Performance requirements are documented
- [ ] Accessibility standards are met

## ðŸ”§ **Tool Integration**

### **Recommended Documentation Stack**
- **Markdown**: Primary documentation format
- **Mermaid**: Embedded diagrams and flowcharts
- **OpenAPI/Swagger**: API specification and testing
- **JSDoc**: Code documentation generation
- **Storybook**: UI component documentation
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated documentation workflows

### **Validation Tools**
- **markdownlint**: Markdown style and syntax checking
- **vale**: Prose linting and style guide enforcement
- **linkchecker**: Automated link validation
- **axe-core**: Accessibility testing and validation
- **lighthouse**: Performance and quality metrics

## ðŸ“Š **Success Metrics**

Monitor these metrics to ensure documentation quality:
- **Coverage**: Percentage of features with complete documentation
- **Freshness**: Time between code changes and documentation updates
- **Quality**: Automated quality scores and manual review ratings
- **Usability**: Developer feedback and onboarding success rates
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance scores and user testing results
