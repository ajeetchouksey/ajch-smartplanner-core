# Data Storage & Sync

## Features
- Minimal cloud data storage for shared/aggregated data
- Local data sync and persistence for user privacy
- Data export/import utilities for portability
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Data retention and deletion policies
- Compliance with privacy regulations

## Tech Implementation
- Azure Cosmos DB, Blob Storage for shared/aggregated data
- Local storage (IndexedDB, SQLite, etc.) for user data on device
- Secure RESTful APIs for data sync, export, and import
- Data encryption and access controls
- Logging and monitoring for data operations
- Compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other regulations

## Reusability
- Shared storage and sync logic for all planner apps
- Modular for future expansion to new data types or domains
- Easily integrated with other reusable services (auth, profile, analytics)

## Example API Endpoints
- `POST /data/sync` — Sync data between device and cloud
- `GET /data/export` — Export user data
- `POST /data/import` — Import user data
- `DELETE /data` — Delete user data

## Deployment Considerations
- Infrastructure as code (IaC) for repeatable deployments
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Environment configuration for dev, test, prod
- Monitoring, alerting, and logging for reliability

## Alignment & Relevance
- This document supports planning, coding, and deployment of data storage and sync as a reusable, privacy-compliant service for the SmartPlanner platform.
