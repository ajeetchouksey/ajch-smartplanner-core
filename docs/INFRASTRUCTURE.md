# Infrastructure Plan

## Principles
- **Minimize Cost:** Use free tiers, serverless, and managed services where possible.
- **Reuse Components:** Share infrastructure (auth, AI, storage) across all apps.
- **Scale Gradually:** Start small, add resources only as needed.

---

## Core Infrastructure Requirements

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- **MCP Server/Service:** Deploy an MCP-compliant server or service to manage context, traceability, and governance for AI/ML models and app interactions.
- **Integration:** Ensure all AI/ML services and apps can communicate with the MCP layer for standardized context exchange.

### 1. Compute
- **Azure Functions (Serverless):**
  - Host core services (auth, AI, compliance, APIs)
  - Free tier: 1M requests/month
  - Scales automatically, pay only for usage

### 2. Storage
- **Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL):**
  - Store minimal, aggregated user data
  - Free tier: 400 RU/s, 5GB
- **Azure Blob Storage:**
  - Store files/images if needed
  - Free tier: 5GB for first 12 months
- **Local Storage (Client-side):**
  - Store original user data on device
  - No cloud cost

### 3. Authentication
- **Azure AD B2C:**
  - Centralized user authentication
  - Free tier: 50,000 monthly active users
  - Supports social login (Google, Facebook, Microsoft)

### 4. AI/ML Services
- **Azure OpenAI & Cognitive Services:**
  - Use only for essential features (recommendations, chatbots)
  - Monitor usage to stay within free/low-cost tier
- **Azure ML (Optional):**
  - For custom model training/deployment
  - Use only if needed

### 5. Networking & API
- **Direct HTTPS Calls:**
  - Apps call Azure Functions directly
  - Skip API Management initially to reduce cost
- **Add Azure API Management later if needed**

### 6. Monitoring & Logging
- **Azure Monitor/Application Insights:**
  - Basic monitoring and logging
  - Free tier available

### 7. DevOps
- **GitHub Actions:**
  - Free CI/CD for public repos
  - Automate builds, tests, deployments

## Cost-Saving Recommendations
- Use free tiers for all Azure services where possible
- Share infrastructure (auth, AI, storage) across all apps
- Use serverless (Azure Functions) to avoid idle costs
- Store original user data locally to minimize cloud storage
- Monitor usage and scale only when needed
- Use open-source tools for development and testing

---

## Next Steps
1. Set up Azure Functions for core services
2. Configure Azure AD B2C for authentication
3. Use Cosmos DB and Blob Storage only for minimal shared data
4. Integrate Azure OpenAI/Cognitive Services for essential AI features
5. Automate deployments with GitHub Actions
6. Document all resources and costs
