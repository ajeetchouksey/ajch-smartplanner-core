# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Service

## Features
- Standardized context sharing for AI/ML features and app interactions
- Interoperability and governance for models and data
- Traceability of model interactions and context changes
- Context versioning and audit
- Privacy and consent management for context data

## Tech Implementation
- MCP-compliant server/service for context management
- RESTful or gRPC APIs for context exchange and traceability
- Integration with AI/ML services, planner apps, and chatbot
- Secure storage and encryption of context data
- Logging and monitoring for context operations
- Compliance with privacy, audit, and governance standards

## Reusability
- Core protocol and service for all AI-powered features and apps
- Modular for future expansion to new models, domains, or context types
- Easily integrated with other reusable services (auth, analytics, audit)

## Example API Endpoints
- `POST /mcp/context` — Create or update context
- `GET /mcp/context` — Retrieve context
- `GET /mcp/history` — Get context change history
- `POST /mcp/consent` — Manage user consent for context sharing

## Deployment Considerations
- Infrastructure as code (IaC) for repeatable deployments
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Environment configuration for dev, test, prod
- Monitoring, alerting, and logging for reliability

## Alignment & Relevance
- This document supports planning, coding, and deployment of MCP as a reusable, governance-focused service for the SmartPlanner platform.
