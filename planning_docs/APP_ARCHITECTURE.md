### State Management Strategy
- **React Context** for global app state (user, theme, notifications)
- **Zustand** for feature-specific state (plans, analytics data)
- **React Query** for server state management and caching

### API Integration
- **REST API** for CRUD operations
- **WebSocket** for real-time updates and notifications
- **GraphQL** (future) for complex data fetching
- **Service Workers** for offline capabilities
